# dalmatian_breed_show_site

The project is a self-made website dedicated to a private Dalmatian breeding business. It was created using HTML and CSS without relying on external frameworks or libraries. 
The website serves as an informational platform, showcasing details about the breeding process, available puppies, and contact information for potential buyers.

* The website had minor problems with responsiveness, particularly on smaller screens (e.g., mobile devices).
* Some elements, like images and tables, did not scale perfectly, causing layout inconsistencies.
* This was a learning opportunity to understand the importance of responsive design.

  PS. For GitHub.com, unfortunately, I had to delete two videos, please take this into account when reviewing the project
